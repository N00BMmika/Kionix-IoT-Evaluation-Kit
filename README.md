# Kionix IoT Evaluation Kit

The Kionix IoT Evaluation Kit provides a powerful and easy to use environment to begin evaluation of Rohm and Kionix products. Multiple hardware options are supported (Kionix Evaluation Kit HW), as well as common, hardware independent sw tools (Kionix Evaluation Kit SW).

Kionix Windows Sensor Evaluation Software consists of an easy to use graphical user interface for displaying / recording sensor data and a graphical register map editor which allows the user to see and change the content of control registers.

Kionix Multi-OS Evaluation Software, in turn, provides reference implementation for driver sw and also a convenient way to access sensor low level features and versatile data logging functionality.
